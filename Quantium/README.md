# Quantium Data Analytics
The Quantium Data Analytics is part of the Virtual Experience Program in Forage. Under this program, participants will get to experience how to be a data analyst under the Retail Analytics and Strategy Team in Quantium. 

The tasks include 3 stages and deals with analyzing the sales data of chips:

## Task 1: Data validation and customer analytics



## Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing

From the merged data we had cleaned in the previous task, we are now asked to analyze the performance of each trial store (`STORE_NBR=77,86,88`) as compared to the control stores. We don't have any pre-defined control stores, so from the data we would need to select control stores with similar enough measurements to our trial stores before the trial period which began on February 2019 until April 2019. To determine what stores can be in the control group, we first defined the following measurements for each store per month:

- total sales of chips
- number of customers
- average number of transactions per customer
- average number of chips bought per customer
- average price per unit of chips

## Task 3: Analytics and commercial application

For the last task, we are asked to create a report for the client regarding our findings and recommendations from our analysis. The presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W_shFPMcJWQ8Y-vui3hfckpGWVWHhUHXBP8HYIXXVBU/edit?usp=sharing).
